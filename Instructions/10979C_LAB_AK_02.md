# Lab Answer Key:  Module 2: Microsoft Azure management tools
# Lab: Using Microsoft Azure management tools
  
## Exercise 1: Using the Azure PowerShell modules
  
#### Task 1: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Internet Explorer, and then browse to 
        [http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
      .
2.   On the  **Downloads** page, in the **Command-line tools** section, locate **PowerShell**.

4.   When prompted with  **Do you want to run or save** **WindowsAzurePowerShellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.exe**, click  **Run**. This launches the Web Platform Installer (Web PI) 5.0.
5.   If prompted by User Account Control, click  **Yes**.
6.   In the  **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window, on the **Microsoft Azure PowerShell** page, click **Install**.
7.   In the  **Web Platform Installer 5.0** dialog box, click **I Accept**.
8.   When the installation is complete, click  **Finish**. Leave the  **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window open.
>  **Note:** You have the option to install other software related to Microsoft Azure.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, click Start , click  **All apps**, scroll down in the list of apps to the  **Windows PowerShell** folder, click the **Windows PowerShell** folder, and then right-click **Windows PowerShell ISE**. On the shortcut menu, click  **More**, and then click  **Run as administrator**.
2.   If prompted by User Account Control, click  **Yes**.
3.   In the  **PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-Module -ListAvailable
  ```

>  **Note:** The output contains a list of several AzureRM.* modules, the Azure PowerShell module, and the Azure.Storage module.

4.   In the  **PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following command to sign in to your Azure subscription, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Add-AzureRmAccount
  ```
5.   When prompted in the  **Sign in to your account** dialog box, in the **Email or phone** box, type the name of the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
6.   In the  **Password** box, type the corresponding password, and then click **Sign in**. 
>  **Note:** The cmdlet returns the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Task 3: Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
  
1.   Back in the  **PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet to retrieve the same list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```
2.   Copy the value of the  **SubscriptionId** property displayed in the output of the preceding cmdlet by selecting it and then pressing Ctrl+C.
3.   Type the following cmdlet, paste the copied entry after the  _SubscriptionId_ parameter, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <Value of the SubscriptionId property>
  ```

>  **Note:** If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use the preceding cmdlet to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current PowerShell session.

4.   To retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager resources you can create in your subscription, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider
  ```

>  **Note:** The cmdlet lists each Azure Resource Provider, its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it), and the list of resource types you can create by referencing it.

5.   To identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines), in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
  ```
6.   To identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider in the Eastern United States, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute -Location 'East US'
  ```
7.   Close the Windows PowerShell ISE.
8.   Leave Internet Explorer open.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully installed and used the Azure PowerShell modules.


## Exercise 2: Using the Azure CLI
  
#### Task 1: Install the Azure CLI
