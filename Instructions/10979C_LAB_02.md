## Exercise 1: Using the Azure PowerShell modules
  
### Scenario
  
In this exercise, you will install and use the Azure PowerShell modules.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install the Azure PowerShell modules
2.   Connect to your Azure subscription
3.   Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets


#### Task 1: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
-   On MIA-CL1, download and install the Microsoft Azure PowerShell modules from 
        [http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
       by using Web PI 5.0.
>  **Note:** Leave the **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window open. Note that you have the option to install other software related to Azure.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start the Windows PowerShell ISE as an administrator.
2.   In the  **PowerShell ISE** window, list all the available Windows PowerShell modules by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-Module -ListAvailable
  ```

>  **Note:** The output contains a list of several AzureRM.* modules (located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\PowerShell\Resource Manager\AzureResourceManager folder), the Azure PowerShell module (located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\PowerShell\ServiceManagement folder), and the Azure.Storage module (located in the (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\PowerShell\Storage folder).

3.   Sign in to your Azure subscription with the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription by running the following Azure PowerShell cmdlet: 

```
Add-AzureRmAccount
```
>  **Note:** The cmdlet returns the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Task 3: Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
  
1.   Back in the  **PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, retrieve the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```
2.   Select the target Azure subscription by running the following cmdlet, replacing  _&lt;Value of the SubscriptionId property&gt;_ with the value of the **SubscriptionID** property returned by the **Get-AzureRmSubscription** cmdlet:
  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <Value of the SubscriptionId property>
  ```

>  **Note:** If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use the preceding cmdlet to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current PowerShell session.

3.   Retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager resources you can create in your subscription by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider
  ```

>  **Note:** The cmdlet lists each Azure Resource Provider, its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it), and the list of resource types you can create by referencing it.

4.   Identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines) by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
  ```
5.   Identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider in the Eastern United States by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute -Location 'East US'
  ```
6.   Close the Windows PowerShell ISE.
7.   Leave Internet Explorer open.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully installed and used the Azure PowerShell modules.
